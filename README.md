The VM Monitoring Tool is an All-in-One system monitoring application that monitors hardware information of a virtual machine. It tracks CPU details, motherboard specs, memory attributes, system temperatures, power consumption, and voltage values. A Testing tab allows users to perform stress tests on the CPU and other components for optimal performance.


## Features

### CPU Monitoring
- **CPU Name**
- **CPU Clock Speed**
- **Number of Cores and Threads**
- **Cache Levels**

### Motherboard Information
- **Chipset**
- **Manufacturer**
- **BIOS Version**

### Operating System Information
- **Detailed OS specifications and versioning.**

### Graphics Card Information (optional)
- **Information about the graphics card, if available.**

### Memory (RAM) Monitoring
- **Frequency**
- **Type**
- **Size**
- **Number of Channels**

### System Temperatures
- **CPU Temperature**
- **GPU Temperature** (optional)
- **RAM Temperature**
- **VRM Temperature** (optional)

### Power Consumption
- **Real-time power consumption data.**

### Voltage Values
- **Current voltage readings for various components.**

### Testing Tab
- **Perform stress tests on the CPU and other components to evaluate performance under load.**


## Alternative to CPU-Z for Linux

Currently, there is no direct equivalent of CPU-Z available for Linux systems. However, **CPU-X** is an alternative that provides similar functionality, including detailed hardware information. Unfortunately, CPU-X does not include a stress test script, which is a key feature of the **VM Monitoring Tool**. This tool offers comprehensive monitoring and stress testing capabilities for users operating in Linux environments.
